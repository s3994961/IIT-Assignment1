				<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				<p>I was born in Malaysia but migrated to Perth, Australia at an early age where I started my education. After finishing secondary school, I tried a few courses at university including architecture and engineering but found that they did not hold my interest, so I joined the workforce in various roles in hospitality and currently, in retail. I primarily communicate in English though, I can understand Mandarin and the Hakka dialect well, although unfortunately, my communication with them is very weak. I love nature, wildlife, and photography and so hiking is one of my go-to activities. Other interests also include reading, baking, and cooking.</p>

				<h1>Interest in IT (Information Technology)</h1>
				<p>My interest in IT stems from the fascination how technology can improve the quality of life in our daily routines to make things easier and more accessible to people. This started at an early age when my father brought home our first PC (Personal Computer) to improve our education. I fondly remember editing batch files in MS-DOS to be able to load and execute programs in the way I wanted them to work. This was exciting to me as it allowed me to create things on my own and customize things to suit my personal preferences. Since then, my experience in IT has mostly been personal in nature, including building and modifying my own PC as well as setting up and troubleshooting my own devices. Professionally, I briefly worked as a contractor to a large hospital to help in the rollout of new hardware to update older systems. 

 

Several factors led to my choice to enroll at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). Firstly, I am currently working full-time and the flexibility of being able to learn online allows me to further my education while still being employed. Secondly, from my personal research, RMIT is a well reputed education institution that prides itself in producing individuals who have the knowledge and expertise to be ready in the workplace. Also, comparing the units offered in the same degree to other universities, I found the course RMIT offered to be more practical and well rounded. 

 

I expect to learn a great deal of things in my journey at RMIT. On the practical side, I hope to learn about programming in a few languages as well as networking and other areas in computing technology. On the theoretical side, I expect to expand my understanding of what IT can do and contribute to the world and how that, other than the technological aspect of IT, the human element and its interactions is an important part of the equation. Through the combination of practical skills and theory, this would give me a better view on how to best balance technology and its relationship with people. </p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
				<img src="job_ad.png"/>
				<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/59478477?type=standout#sol=67148e6b1dc6b515e09e442895d6c997143da5a3">Azure Cloud Architect Job in Melbourne VIC - SEEK</a></p>
				<p>A cloud architect is a professional in the IT industry that deals with the cloud computing strategy of a business. This can be either maintaining the current cloud infrastructure or even adopting and creating an entirely new cloud solution. It requires knowledge of many things including operating systems, security, and networking, among others. This role appeals to me as I believe I would enjoy understanding and working with many components which come together to work together and the optimisation of it to work seamlessly as one system. 

 

There is a myriad of skills required to become a successful Cloud Architect. This includes leadership and communication, adaptability, and good problem-solving skills. Many technical skills are also necessary to be proficient such as virtualisation, security, operating systems, networking, and programming languages. The knowledge of all these skills helps the architect create a solution which can work cohesively to the needs of the business. Certain qualifications may also be helpful and/or necessary for the role. This may include a Bachelor of IT or Computer Science or similar. Industry-specific certifications such as Microsoft Azure certifications may also be needed. 

 

Currently, I believe I have the communication and leadership skills required from my experience in the workforce, as well as the adaptability and flexibility that the role requires. As I have worked in both the hospitality and retail industries, the fast paced and ever-changing environment, and schedules, have taught me to be both adaptable and accommodating. Being in a supervisory role has also given me experience in people management and conflict resolution. However, to be proficient in this role, I am severely lacking in technical knowledge and understanding. 

 

To prepare myself for this position, I will continue to study at RMIT and complete my Bachelor of IT. Along the way, I should also try to gain an entry level position in the field of IT to gather experience working in that field. As I gain more experience, I will strive to learn more and increase my knowledge in other roles and positions such as networking. This knowledge will be gained as I continue my course but also, I may seek to obtain industry recognised certifications such as CompTIA or Cisco certifications. As I gain more understanding in more aspects of the IT field, I can then start exploring cloud computing through Microsoft Azure certifications. </p>
